<h3>Car Insurance Project</h3>
<p>This project is an MVC web application made to function as a quote calculator for a car insurance company. After the user fills out some information, the app uses business logic to determine that user's monthly cost. This project also includes an admin page, which allows staff to view all active quotes.</p>

<h3>Twenty One Game</h3>
<p>In this project, I created a console application of the popular card game, Twenty One. To try and imitate a casino setting, the game allows the user to wager tokens and has built-in security methods in case the user tries to cheat. All dealt cards are logged in a text file with their timestamp, giving the "casino" a record of each hand. </p>
