<h3>Car Insurance Project</h3>
<p>This project is an MVC web application made to function as a quote calculator for a car insurance company. After the user fills out some information, the app uses business logic to determine that user's monthly cost. This project also includes an admin page, which allows staff to view all active quotes.</p>

<h3>Check Files GUI</h3>
<p>In this project, I used tkinter to create a basic GUI that allows users to transfer all .txt files modified within the last 24 hours from one chosen directory to another. The files that are moved are stored within a database.</p>


<h3>Django Checkbook Project</h3>
<p>In this project, I used the Django framework to create a basic checkbook. This project also demonstrates CRUD functionality.</p>
